By merging these two datasets, we can look at and compare the different schools with their student bodies. I was able to sort these out by looking at school size, school budgets, math score, reading score, and the type of school. I ended up analyzing 15 different schools and 39,170 students between them. Here are some observations that were made from this data. 

First, I made a comparison based on the 15 different schools. The top 5 highest performing schools, based on their “% Overall Passing” which considers the percentage of students who passed both reading and math, were all charter schools and the top school, Cabrera High School, having 91.33% of students passing. The worst performing school was Rodriguez High School, only having 52.99% of students passing.

When looking at the budget of schools and their success of their students I was surprised to see that Cabrera High School, $582/student, was in the lowest spending range while Rodriguez High School, $637/student, was the second high grouping despite being the lowest performing school. In fact, based on this data set, the higher budget per student resulted in the lowest performance.

The other thing to consider with this dataset is the size of the schools. Cabrera High School has 1858 students, Medium size school, and Rodriguez High School has 3999 students, Large size school, which is more than twice as many students. The thing to take away from looking at the size of the schools compared to their success is the schools with 2000+ students, Large size schools, had an average “% Overall Passing” of just 58.29%. 

I think the most telling analysis of this data though is based on the school type, either district school or charter school. The charter schools had a success pass rate of 90.43% compared to that of 53.67% for district schools.
